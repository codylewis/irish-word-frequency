## Irish Word Frequency

This is the source code for the [Irish Word Frequency](https://codylewis.github.io/irish-word-frequency/) application. The applications hosts approximately 6,500 Irish lemmas (words) ordered by frequency of use. [Michal Měchura](https://cadhan.com/lsg/) extracted this dataset from the Irish half of the [New Corpus for Ireland](https://corpas.focloir.ie/) and then cleaned it up by cross-checking against a large-coverage lexicon (Kevin Scannell's [Líonra Séimeantach na Gaeilge](https://cadhan.com/lsg/)).
